# 🤖 Emoji Character Builder

A creative SwiftUI prototype that builds a full emoji-based character using stacked views and transformations.

## 🎨 What It Does

- Creates a fun character with face, arms, and robotic legs.
- Uses SwiftUI's `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ZStack` for layout.
- Applies `rotation3DEffect` and `offset` for dynamic emoji positioning.
- Adds potential for accessories like sunglasses.

## 🧱 Tools & Technologies

- Language: **Swift**
- Framework: **SwiftUI**
- Emoji magic 🪄


## 🧠 How It Works

- The arms and legs use mirrored emojis via 3D rotation.
- The face is placed in the center of the `HStack`.
- Optional accessories (like 🕶️) can be layered on top using `ZStack`.

## 🚀 Future Ideas

- Add animation when clicking parts of the character
- Let the user change expressions or outfits
- Build a mini game using the emoji avatar
