# 🍪 Counter App

A simple and fun SwiftUI app that tracks how many cookies you've eaten — and reminds you when you're overdoing it!  

## 📱 Features

- Count cookies with a single tap (`+🍪` button).
- Remove a cookie if needed (`-🍪` button).
- Reset the counter to 0.
- Motivational/funny messages based on how many cookies you've eaten.
- High Score tracking using `@AppStorage`.

## 🛠️ Built With

- SwiftUI  
- `@State` and `@AppStorage` for state management  
- Xcode

## 🧠 Logic Highlights

- Message updates based on cookie count:
  - 20+ cookies: _"Don't Eat Too Many Cookies"_
  - 30+ cookies: _"You Good?"_
  - 40+ cookies: _"You're Cooked"_

- High score is saved even when the app restarts.
